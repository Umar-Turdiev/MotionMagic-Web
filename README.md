**Motion Magic** is an interactive 2D physics visualization tool designed to simplify complex physics concepts for educational purposes. Inspired by the challenges faced in physics class, the aim is to create a user-friendly platform that allows for intuitive scene creation and interaction visualization.

**Motion Magic** is designed first-hand with a focus on user experience. **Motion Magic** is built with Angular, and utilizing the Rapier physics engine for physics simulation. The ultimate goal is to provide a seamless learning experience, enabling users to concentrate on learning physics concepts without the hassle of navigating complex software interfaces. This tool is designed to be an aid for educators and students alike, facilitating the creation, sharing, and visualization of diverse physics scenarios with ease.

## Key Features

* **Realistic Physics** - Get accurate simulations providing a reliable representation of physical interactions. Simulate a wide range of concepts in Physics, including friction, linear velocity, linear momentum, impulse, angular velocity, and angular momentum.
* **Shape Editor** - Easily drag to draw rectangles, circles, ramps, and much more. Every shape can easily scale, rotate, move using the amazing shape controls.
* **Touch Support** - Designed with touch devices in mind, bringing you the smooth user experience.
* **Built-in Note Taking** - Pen, highlighter, laser pointer, you name it. Each pen-tool's color, thickness, and opacity can all be customized to your taste.
* **Vector Visualization** - Draw forces and velocity vectors on the screen to analyze and understand the dynamics of different objects.
* **Graphing Plotter** - Generate and view graphs such as velocity vs. time (v vs t), aiding in the analysis of motion and other physical phenomena.
* **Comprehensive Watch Panel** - Monitor the properties of objects in real-time, including position, velocity, and external forces acting on the object of interest.
* **Vector to Component Converter** - Easily convert vectors into their component forms for simplified calculations and analysis.
* **Real-Time Collaboration** - Work with others in real time, sharing and editing scenes collaboratively to enhance group learning experiences.
* **Scene Saving Capabilities** - Save and load scenes easily, allowing for continuity in learning and teaching sessions.
